# 🔍 ShadowScope – Shodan Recon Toolkit

**ShadowScope** is a powerful but beginner-friendly GUI-based recon tool built using the [Shodan API](https://www.shodan.io/). It allows you to quickly inspect the public exposure of any IP address or domain — revealing open ports, services, banners, and even geolocation and OS data — all with just a few clicks.

> ⚠️ This tool does **not** perform active scanning. It only queries Shodan's existing indexed data, making it safe and passive for red teamers, researchers, and students.
